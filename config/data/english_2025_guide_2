Organic matter can be used to feed animals or used as fertilizer. Bones produce fat, gelatin and calcium which can be used in animal feed or to make filters.\nAmong the many advantages of recycling are: saving valuable natural resources, preventing land pollution, saving manufacturers' money, creating a lot of jobs (to recycle the waste of Cairo would need 17,000 - 20,000 collectors, 6,000 sorters plus transporters, processors ...etc.), creating new small businesses which can supply many of the major industries and generating money (e.g. in Cairo, if all the rubbish that could be recycled was recycled, it would generate $ 73, 467 a day).\nFor recycling to be a success, it needs the support of the government in supplying areas for dumping, sorting and recycling, and to launch a campaign to persuade the public to co-operate. It needs experts to find suitable people or companies to recycle each material.\nAll the way along the line, from the collector to the seller of the recycled product, there has to be an acceptable income.
