It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction with normal temperatures. It is one of the most common diseases of children, but adults can have asthma, too. Asthma causes wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing at night or early in the morning. Genetic, environmental and occupational factors are main causes for asthma. If you have asthma, you will suffer from it all the time. You will have asthma attacks only when something bothers your lungs. The attack happens in your body's airways, which are the paths that carry air to your lungs. As the air moves through your lungs, the airways become smaller. During an asthma attack, less air gets in and out of your lungs. People can control asthma by avoiding some things that may lead to it or what we can call 'asthma triggers'. They are different from someone to another, but there are some common ones as tobacco smoke, dust mites, outdoor air pollution, pets, mold, smoke from burning wood or grass, and infections like flu. Asthma can be treated by breathing some medicines or taking some pills according to the doctor's advice. The effect of these two ways of medication can be either to have a quick-relief control to ease the symptoms of an asthma attack or to have a long control to have fewer and milder attacks."
