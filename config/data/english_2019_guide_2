    "question_answer": "Sample answer: A world without trees would be catastrophic for all life forms. Trees produce oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide, prevent soil erosion, and provide habitats for countless species. Without them, air quality would deteriorate dramatically, leading to respiratory diseases. The loss of tree roots would cause massive soil erosion and flooding. Many animals would become extinct as their habitats disappear. The climate would change drastically as trees regulate temperature and rainfall patterns. Human life would become extremely difficult without wood products, fruits, and medicinal compounds derived from trees. This bleak scenario demonstrates why we must protect existing forests and plant more trees to ensure a sustainable future for our planet."
