    "question_answer": "Sample answer: Technology has profoundly transformed our lives in both positive and negative ways. On one hand, it has made communication instantaneous, provided access to vast information, and improved healthcare through advanced medical equipment. On the other hand, excessive screen time has reduced face-to-face interactions, and privacy concerns have emerged with data collection. While technology increases productivity, it also creates dependency, making basic skills like mental arithmetic less common. The key is finding balance – leveraging technology's benefits while maintaining essential human connections and skills. Ultimately, technology is a tool whose impact depends on how we choose to use it in our daily lives."
