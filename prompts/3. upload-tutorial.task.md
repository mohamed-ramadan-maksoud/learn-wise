# TASK: Tutorial Upload & RAG Search API Implementation

## Objective
Implement robust, SOLID-compliant endpoints for uploading tutorials (with paragraph-level embeddings) and performing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) search over tutorial content.

---

## Requirements

### 1. Tutorials Table Migration
- Write a migration script to safely alter the `tutorials` table to match the new schema (paragraph-level, embeddings, etc).
- Ensure all new columns are added if missing (id, title, content, subject, chapter, paragraph_number, tags, difficulty, type, media_url, duration, author_id, view_count, rating, embedding, created_at, updated_at).

### 2. Upload/Upsert API
- Endpoint: `/api/tutorials/upload`
- Accepts a tutorial payload with metadata and an array of paragraphs (each with content, paragraph_number, and embedding).
- For each paragraph:
  - Upsert (insert or update) by `id` and `paragraph_number`.
  - Store embedding vector.
- Use a service class for business logic and a repository for DB access.
- Controller should be minimal, delegating to service.

### 3. RAG Search API
- Endpoint: `POST /api/tutorials/rag-search`
- Accepts a query and maxResults.
- Generates embedding for query.
- Performs vector search (e.g., pgvector cosine similarity) over tutorial paragraphs.
- Returns top matching paragraphs with metadata and similarity.
- Use the same service/repository/helper structure as above.

### 4. Code Organization & SOLID Principles
- Business logic in service classes.
- Data access in repository classes.
- Shared utilities (embedding, chunking) in helpers.
- Controllers should only handle request/response.

---

## Deliverables
- Migration script for `tutorials` table.
- Service, repository, and helper modules for tutorials.
- Two endpoints: upload/upsert and RAG search.
- Example payloads and responses.
- Code should be modular, testable, and follow SOLID principles.

---

## Debugging/Logging
- Add debug logs for all upsert and search operations.
- Log all DB joins and vector search results for traceability.

## Reference
See `/v1/ai/rag-answer` for response structure consistency.
