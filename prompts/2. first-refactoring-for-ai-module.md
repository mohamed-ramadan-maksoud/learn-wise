# LearnWise AI Backend Refactoring Guide

## Overview

This refactoring separates the AI module into clear layers for maintainability, testability, and scalability. The main goals are to follow the open/closed principle, reduce duplication, and make the codebase easy to extend.

## Structure

- `modules/ai/routes.js`  
  Defines Fastify routes. Only handles request validation, calls service methods, and sends responses.

- `modules/ai/ai.service.js`  
  Contains all business logic for AI features (embedding, RAG answer generation, etc). Calls repository and helper functions.

- `modules/ai/ai.repository.js`  
  Handles all data access (Supabase queries, etc). No business logic.

- `modules/ai/ai.helper.js`  
  Contains utility functions for formatting, response building, and data transformation.

- `schemas/ai.js`  
  Contains all OpenAPI/Fastify schema definitions for AI routes.

## Benefits

- **Separation of concerns:** Each file has a single responsibility.
- **Open/closed principle:** Add new features by extending services/helpers, not modifying route handlers.
- **Testability:** Business logic and data access can be tested independently.
- **Maintainability:** Clear structure makes onboarding and future changes easier.

## Example Usage

- To add a new AI feature, create a new method in `ai.service.js` and call it from the route.
- To change how responses are formatted, update `ai.helper.js`.
- To add a new data source, extend `ai.repository.js`.

## Next Steps

- Move all business logic from `routes.js` to `ai.service.js`.
- Move all Supabase/database queries to `ai.repository.js`.
- Move all formatting and response-building logic to `ai.helper.js`.
- Update route handlers to use the new service and helper methods.
- Move schema definitions to `schemas/ai.js`.
