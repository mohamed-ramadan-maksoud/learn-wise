# Prompt for AI: Exam Data Model and Processing Requirements

## Tasks

1. **Embed Question Content (Not Title)**
   - When generating or processing embeddings, use the full text/content of the question, *not* the question title.

2. **Support Exam Types**
   - Add an `exam_type` field to each exam.
   - Supported values: `final`, `guide`, `mock`, etc.

3. **Exam Versioning**
   - Each exam should include a `version` field.
   - Default value for new exams: `1`.

4. **Question Answers**
   - Each question must have an explicit `answer` field containing the correct answer.

5. **Verification Status for Generated Questions**
   - For AI-generated questions, add a `verified_by_teacher` column/field.
   - Default value: `false`.
